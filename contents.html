                is our belief that by that time RA must be generating revenue from local advertising to pay for the
                service. The cost is
                designed in such a way that even if the RA designs, hosts and manages a website without using the
                OURAREA service, the
                net revenue they realize after paying costs is more than from using the OURAREA service. You will find
                that hosting a
                website that does not go down is expensive. But we are able to do this as we host and manage many sites.
                So we trust
                that you find this fair.
